**Developed Real-Time Number Plate Detection System:**
Utilized OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade classifier to create a robust solution for detecting vehicle number plates from live webcam feeds, applying advanced image processing techniques for effective object recognition.

**Implemented Dynamic Frame Analysis and Annotation:**
Incorporated real-time frame-by-frame analysis to identify and annotate detected number plates with bounding rectangles and labels, enhancing visual identification and verification of detected objects.

**Optimized ROI Extraction and Image Saving Mechanism:**
Designed and integrated a system for extracting and saving the Region of Interest (ROI) where the number plate is detected, enabling efficient capture and storage of relevant images for subsequent review or analysis.

**Integrated Interactive User Features:**
Developed interactive features, including the ability to save detected number plates with a keystroke, and provided real-time user feedback through on-screen notifications and visual indicators to improve user experience and system functionality.
